# Fuckin Balls


Sorry, ninja code. No comments.

You need to make this modification at your ESP32 PCB. 
Add two pushbuttons and a MPU6050 PCB

You have a Game of life, a calibration routine with the famous ZX-Spectrum character Sir Fred! and the Fuckin Balls.
I hope new improvements from you and a best collide routine :p
Enjoy!
